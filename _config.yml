  Hi, my name's Theo and I'm an aspiring robotics engineer. I'm passionate about new technologies, how they work and how to apply them to have an impact on the world. With a background in Mechanical Engineering, specializations in Robotics and Machine Learning and two years of industry experience with AMR deployment, I'm looking for new opportunities to grow and learn.<br><br>
  Currently pursuing a M.S in Mechatronics and Robotics at New York University. Graduating in December 2025.

          Developed an interactive SCARA robotic system that replicates user drawings in real-time. The system uses a Raspberry Pi camera to track an ArUco marker on a stylus, with ROS and OpenCV processing the visual input. Inverse kinematics translate the tracked motion into commands for the Arduino-controlled SCARA arm, featuring Dynamixel servos and a custom compliant end-effector for precise drawing on various surfaces. This project showcases the integration of computer vision, embedded control, and robotics for human-guided tasks.<br>
