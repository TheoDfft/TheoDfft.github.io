  Hi, my name's Theo and I'm an aspiring robotics engineer. I'm passionate about new technologies, how they work and how to apply them to have an impact on the world. With a background in Mechanical Engineering, a specialization in Robotics and Machine Learning and two years of industry experience with AMR deployment, I'm looking for new opportunities to grow and learn.
  
  Currently pursuing a M.S in Mechatronics and Robotics at New York University. Graduating in December 2025.

          <b><u>Why?</u></b> To enhance building security and convenience, leveraging cutting-edge <mark>IoT</mark> and <mark>machine learning</mark> technologies to automatically monitor entryways, recognize faces, and notify owners in real time of who is entering their premises.

          <b><u>What?</u></b> Developed an innovative IoT device using a <mark>Jetson Nano</mark> and webcam, integrated with <mark>OpenCV</mark> for facial recognition, that activates upon movement detection. It illuminates the area, initiates face recognition, and alerts owners via push notifications, while storing entry data for historical review.

          <b><u>How?</u></b> Utilized <mark>Python</mark> for backend logic, <mark>JavaScript</mark>, <mark>HTML</mark>, and <mark>CSS</mark> for a user-friendly web interface, and <mark>SQL</mark> for data management. The project employs Flask for server-side operations, enabling real-time monitoring and history tracking, and provides functionality for users to upload new known faces for facial recognition.

            Deployed and maintained Locus' AMR fleet at customer sites. Gained expertise in SLAM, Embedded Linux and robotic support with ROS.

            Developed deployment standards and tools for newly acquired robots. Programmed, tested and deployed brand new fleet management features (queueing, autonomous charging routine, custom warehouse workflow, etc) but also individual robots behaviors (navigation and path-planning algorithms, pickup/dropoff actuations, recovery mechanisms).
